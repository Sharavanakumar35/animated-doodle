"# animated-doodle" 

This repo is created for giving intro on Git and Github.

Things I did for making this repo:

+ Created an empty repo name `animated-doodle` in [Github](https://github.com/new)
+ Copied the contents from the page titled `create a new repo on the command line` and the lines are,
```
echo "# animated-doodle" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sharavanakumar35/animated-doodle.git
git push -u origin main
```
+ I have created an empty folder in y file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. After opened CMD, I just copy-pasted the lines one-by-one. 
+ The first line `echo "# animated-doodle" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the content `"# animated-doodle"`.
